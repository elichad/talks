# Introduction

## About Me

* 2018: MSci Physics from University of Birmingham
    * Final project in computational astrophysics
* 2018-2022: Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)
    * 2-year Scientific Computing graduate scheme
    <!-- * 3-month placement at Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL)-->
    * Permanent project on muon spectroscopy simulations
    * Delivered training workshops for early career staff (graduates, apprentices)
* 2021: Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship (focus: training and accessibility)
* 2023: The Carpentries - IT Developer

## Why This Career Path?

* Wanted to remain close to research and academia after graduating
* But I do not like doing research enough to do a PhD
* What I do like is writing scientific code

---

## Why This Career Path?
    
My ideal job: *writing code that helps people to do their research*

This has a name: **Research Software Engineering**

If you develop software to support your own research or that of others, you are doing Research Software Engineering! 

---

## Why I'm Here

* At STFC I learned various approaches to software engineering, testing, etc.
* These would have been useful during my degree, but they were never mentioned during my programming modules
* Realised that I left uni with *advanced coding skills, but minimal knowledge of best practices*
* Now I support other early-career researchers coming behind me
    * Led workshops at STFC, supported by SSI Fellowship
    * Supported learners to become instructors in later years

<!-- * Led workshops for new starters at STFC to build this knowledge, and supported learners to become instructors in later years

This has a name too: **Community of Practice**

# What We Mean by "Sustainable Software"

## What is Sustainable Software?

**Sustainability** means that the software you use today will be available - and continue to be improved and supported - in the future. <!-- https://software.ac.uk/about -->

Sustainable software is software which is:
– Easy to evolve and maintain
– Fulfils its intent over time
– Survives uncertainty
– Supports relevant concerns (Political, Economic, Social, Technical, Legal, Environmental)

this is weirdly hard to pin down

---

## Aspects of Sustainability

* documentation for users and developers, at all levels of experience
* planning and governance
* support and issue tracking
* community and external contributions
* licensing – the conditions under which a person can use and re-use your software
* funding and contributor time

---

## More Aspects of Sustainability

* availability and accessibility
* compatibility with operating systems, browsers, and/or assistive technology
* software design and coding standards 
* testing
* version control (e.g. Git)

---

## Why Go to All This Effort?

 - Good software practices create better software
 - Better software improves the reproducibility and reusability of research
 - read that article by carole so I can argue this better

# Stages of Sustainability

## How Sustainable is Your Software?

We're now going to look at different levels of sustainability that a project could be at

Think of a project that you work on, and try to figure out where it is on the scale

There is no shame in a project being at the lower end – only space for improvement
