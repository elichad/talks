# Introduction

## About Me

* Crochet since 2018
* Loom knitting since 2021
* I have taught people to use Unix and Git... but I have not taught people how to crochet
* I will probably make mistakes or not explain things well

. . .

* Fortunately, I have help!

## Workshop Objectives

* Be comfortable handling your hook and yarn and forming basic stitches
* Know how to follow a crochet pattern
* Feel confident enough to continue practicing on your own
* Contribute to the community blanket!

# Yarn, Hooks, And Other Materials

## Yarn

![](images/label_front.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Ball of yarn with label showing brand and weight"}

## Weight

![](images/yarn-weights-and-wpi-1536x1434.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Table of yarn weights. The yarn in this workshop is category 5, aka bulky or chunky."}

## Fibre and dye lot

![](images/label_fibre.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Zoomed yarn label showing the fibre is 100% acrylic, the shade is HEC08 GREEN, and the dye lot is 80."}

. . .

Exact colour may vary between balls of same shade - if buying lots of balls of the same color, try to match the dye lot

We'll talk more about fibre choices later

## Gauge and care instructions

![](images/label_gauge.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Zoomed yarn label showing that 6mm hooks/needles should be used, the gauge is 14 sts/20 rows for a 10x10 cms square, and the yarn should be washed gently and cool."}

. . .

It's a good idea to keep labels so you know how to care for your projects

## Hooks

![](images/hooks.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Eli's collection of crochet hooks, ranging from 3 mm to 20 mm."}

Hooks are cheap (~£2 each) and can be bought individually or in sets

## Hook anatomy

![](images/hook_anatomy.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Anatomy of a crochet hook. The long part is called the shaft and may have a grip or thumb rest. The hook part is called the head, and features a throat which is a narrow straight part, a point or tip where the hook turns back on itself, a lip which juts backwards, and a bowl which is the inside of the lip and throat."}

. . .

Some of our hooks have ergonomic handles, some do not - please swap if the one you have isn't working for you

## Hook size

![](images/hook_zoom.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="The size indicator at the end of a hook shaft furthest from the head. This one reads USJ10/6.00mm."}

Your hook size should match your yarn label (in most cases)

## Other materials

* tape measure/ruler
* yarn needle aka darning needle aka tapestry needle - we'll use this at the end
* stitch markers - optional, but useful for some patterns
* scissors
