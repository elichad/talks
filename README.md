# Talks by Eli Chadwick

This repository contains
* Markdown talk slides
* their associated images, code, and theming
* a minimal GitHub Pages site that hosts the rendered slides

## Find a talk

Each talk has a dedicated folder, named using the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-location-title` or `YYYY-MM-DD-event-title`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date the talk was/will be given.

The talks are written in Markdown and then rendered into HTML slides using Quarto. Inside each talk folder, there is a `.qmd` file which contains the Markdown used to generate the talk, and an `.html` file which is the rendered slides.

You can view the rendered HTML slides through this repository's [GitHub Pages site](https://elichad.github.io/talks).
