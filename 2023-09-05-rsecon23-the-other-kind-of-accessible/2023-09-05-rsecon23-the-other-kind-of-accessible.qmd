# Introduction

## About Me

* RSE for 5 years
* SSI Fellow since 2021
* Currently an IT Developer at The Carpentries
* Use voice control and eye tracking software due to chronic RSI
* Started studying disability and accessibility after discovering how much harder it was to use the web with assistive tech

## Motivation

* I straddle two worlds - RSE and web accessibility
* The word "accessible" is thrown around a lot in both
* But it means very different things

. . .

* Sometimes see 'software ergonomics,' 'software usability,' mentioned in RSE space
* These tread the same ground, but rarely mention disability

. . .

* I want to bring disability back into these conversations
* There is accessibility expertise in industry that we as RSEs can learn from

# What is the "Other Kind of Accessible"?

## "Accessible" in FAIR for research software ^[[Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x) by Michelle Barker, Neil P. Chue Hong, Daniel S. Katz, Anna-Lena Lamprecht, Carlos Martinez-Ortiz, Fotis Psomopoulos, Jennifer Harrow, Leyla Jael Castro, Morane Gruenpeter, Paula Andrea Martinez, and Tom Honeyman]

**Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardised protocols**.

A1. Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardised communications protocol.

A1.1. The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.

A1.2. The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.

A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available.

## "Accessible" in a disability context

"Accessibility means that [disabled] people can do what they need to do in a **similar amount of time and effort** as someone that does not have a disability. It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented." ^[[What we mean when we talk about accessibility](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-accessibility-2/) by Alistair Duggin]

. . .

**The A in FAIR does not cover this!**

## Digital Accessibility, a.k.a. "a11y"

a11y is a numeronym - like an acronym, but with numbers

Typically pronounced "ah-lee" or "A-eleven-Y"

![Image © [The A11y Collective](https://www.a11y-collective.com)](images/a11y-numeronym.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A graphic explaining the origin of the a11y numeronym by showing the 11 letters between a and y in accessibility."}


# Disability and Barriers

## Models of Disability: Medical model ^[[Introduction to the Social and Medical Models of Disability](https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/sites/default/files/FDN-218144_Introduction_to_the_Social_and_Medical_Models_of_Disability.pdf)]

:::{.incremental}
* Disability is the result of an impairment
* Treatment aims to ‘fix’ the disability or provide special individual services
* The disabled individual is expected to take the responsibility for adjusting
* “She can’t read the newspaper because she is blind”
:::

## Models of Disability: Social model ^[[Introduction to the Social and Medical Models of Disability](https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/sites/default/files/FDN-218144_Introduction_to_the_Social_and_Medical_Models_of_Disability.pdf)]

:::{.incremental}
* Disability is the result of barriers in society; separate to impairment
* A person may be more disabled by some environments than others
* It is everyone’s responsibility to remove barriers that disable people
* “She can’t read the newspaper because it’s not published in large text or Braille”
:::

. . .

**The social model is broadly preferred by the disabled community**

. . .

Ask yourself: what barriers exist within my software that I could remove?

::: {.notes}
https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/sites/default/files/FDN-218144_Introduction_to_the_Social_and_Medical_Models_of_Disability.pdf
:::

## Barriers We Create

* Text formatting - colour, size, font
* Screen reader incompatibility
* Lack of captions/transcripts
* Small buttons and other controls
* Controls that don't support both keyboard & mouse
* Complex page layout
* Complex text
* Animations, especially moving/flickering/blinking content
* Lack of instruction
* Lack of support
* Inaccessible events
* ...

## Example study - Jupyter Notebooks

In a study of 100,000 randomly chosen Jupyter notebooks: ^[[Notably Inaccessible -- Data Driven Understanding of Data Science Notebook (In)Accessibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03241) by Venkatesh Potluri, Sudheesh Singanamalla, Nussara Tieanklin, and Jennifer Mankoff]

* 48.36% start with a heading in the first cell
* 4.53% of notebooks included data tables after a chart
* 0.19% of notebook images had alt text - and most of those are just "image," "png," "alt," etc.

. . .

The study also found systemic issues:

* matplotlib doesn't support embedding alt text into image files
* Jupyter default themes for HTML exports don't meet a11y guidelines

# Why Should I Care?

## I don't have disabled users!

::: {.incremental}
* Are you sure?
* Are you sure that you will _never_ have disabled users?
* Are disabled people who _want_ to be your users turned away at the point of entry?
    * They will not tell you
    * They will just leave

## It's the law

UK Equality Act 2010

* "...where a provision, criterion or practice of A's puts a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage... take such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage." ^[[Equality Act 2010, Section 20 (3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/20)]

Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018

* You must make your website or mobile app more accessible by making it ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’. ^[[Understanding accessibility requirements for public sector bodies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)]

# What Can I Do?

## Suggestions Incoming

You don't have to do all these things at once

Pick one thing that resonates, and focus on that first

. . .

A lot of the resources I share are focused on web development

But there are parts that apply to every project, be it web, GUI, or CLI

## I'm a developer

Basic checks:

:::{.incremental}
* Try completing tasks with only the keyboard, or only the mouse
* Try different visual settings (200% zoom, high contrast, greyscale)
* Check your use of colour ([sufficient contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html), other styling)
* [web only] Try an automated testing tool such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
:::

. . .

Or pick a checklist to follow for a deeper dive:

* [A learn-as-you-do accessibility checklist](https://uxdesign.cc/a-learn-as-you-do-accessibility-checklist-c657d9ed2c62)
* [A11y Project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
* [Perform an accessibility review on your website](https://kb.iu.edu/d/atmv)

## I create papers, blog posts, videos...

:::{.incremental}
* Check use of colour
* Ensure non-decorative images have alt text
* Provide a text alternative or data table for complex images such as charts, graphs, maps
* Ensure videos have human-generated captions and/or transcripts
* Remember that headings and tables are useful landmarks
:::

## I guide project direction

:::{.incremental}
* Set a11y requirements and targets for development
    * Use automated a11y tests in CI (we use [pa11y](https://pa11y.org))
    * Prioritise a11y in the planning process
    * **Treat a11y issues as bugs**
* Arrange user testing, including disabled users
* Arrange a professional a11y audit
* Ask: are there barriers in the _development process_ that would prevent some people from contributing?
:::

## I guide organisational direction

:::{.incremental}
* Set a11y requirements and targets for projects
* Invest in a11y training for developers
* Follow an [accessibility playbook](https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/)
* Consider using a maturity model ([simple](https://www.metamatrix.se/avocado) or [advanced](https://abilitynet.org.uk/accessibility-services/DAMM))
:::

## I can influence funding bodies

:::{.incremental}
* Push for a11y to be prioritised in _all_ research outputs (including but not limited to software)
* Reward grant applications that describe how they will consider and design for disabled users
:::

## I want to learn more

* [web-a11y Slack](web-a11y.slack.com) - a community of practice with thousands of a11y practitioners, from beginner to expert
* [The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/learn/web-accessibility/the-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-introduction-to-web-accessibility) - edX self-study course
* [A11y Project - Resources](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/) - huge collection of books, blogs, podcasts, and tools

Talk to me if you'd like to be part of an a11y-focused subcommunity/learning group!

# Web Accessibility Principles

POUR

# Developer-level suggestions

## Keyboard-only/mouse-only tests

_Important for: users with reduced mobility, screen reader users_

* try to complete a common task using _only_ the keyboard
* are there focus indicators to show you what's selected?
* can you get to all the controls?
![](images/keyboard_focus.png){fig-alt="Grey navigation bar with one element having a blue and white border and lighter text than the rest"}
* now try the same task with _only_ the mouse
* are there focus indicators when you hover over controls?
* do you sometimes need to press a specific keyboard key to continue?
![](images/cursor_focus.png){fig-alt="Grey navigation bar with one element having lighter text than the rest"}

---

## Visual settings tests

_Important for: users with reduced vision and/or colour vision_

* zoom to 200% or more
* enable a high contrast mode (settings: High Contrast/Increase Contrast)
* enable greyscale mode (settings: Color Filters/Color Correction)
