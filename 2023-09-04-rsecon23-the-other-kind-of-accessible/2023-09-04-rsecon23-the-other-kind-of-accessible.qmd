# Introduction

## Introduction

* RSE for 5 years
* Currently an IT Developer at The Carpentries
* Use voice control and eye tracking software due to chronic RSI
* Started studying disability and accessibility after discovering how much harder it was to use the web with assistive tech

<!--
---

## Motivation

* Software ergonomics talk at deRSE
* Good, but barely mentioned disability!
* Bringing back the disability justice angle
* There is a great wealth of accessibility expertise in industry that has not yet made it across to the RSE community

# What is the Other Kind of Accessibility?

## "Accessible" in FAIR for research software

**Findable**: Software, and its associated metadata, is easy for both humans and machines to find.

**Accessible: Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardised protocols.**

**Interoperable**: Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards.

**Reusable**: Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).

_Nothing here discusses whether research software should be usable by all types of people!_

## "Accessible" in a disability context

Ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, older adults, and people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, can access and participate fully in society. This includes access to physical spaces, transportation, **digital content**, and communication.

## Digital Accessibility, a.k.a. "a11y"

a11y is a numeronym - like an acronym, but with numbers

There are 11 letters between the ‘a’ and ‘y’ in 'accessibility'!

Typically pronounced "ah-lee" or "A-eleven-Y"

# Why Should I Care About This?

## I don't have disabled users!

::: {.incremental}
* Are you sure?
* Are you sure that you will _never_ have disabled users?
* Are disabled people who _want_ to be your users turned away at the point of entry?
    * They will not tell you
    * They will just leave

## Models of Disability: Medical model
* Disability is the result of an impairment
* Treatment aims to ‘fix’ the disability or provide special individual services
* The disabled individual is expected to take the responsibility for adjusting
* “She can’t read the newspaper because she is blind”

## Models of Disability: Social model
* Disability is the result of barriers in society, and it is separate to impairment
* A person may be more disabled by some environments than others
* It is everyone’s responsibility to remove barriers that disable people
* “She can’t read the newspaper because it’s not published in large text or Braille”

**The social model is broadly preferred by the disabled community**

Ask yourself: what barriers exist within my software that I could remove?

## It's the law

UK Equality Act 2010

* The first requirement is a requirement, where a provision, criterion or practice of A's puts a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage in relation to a relevant matter in comparison with persons who are not disabled, to take such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage.

Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

# What Can I Do?

## Disclaimer

A lot of the resources I share are focused on web development

But there are parts that apply to every project, be it web, GUI, or CLI

## I'm a developer

Basic checks:

* Try completing tasks with only the keyboard, or only the mouse
* Try different visual settings (200% zoom, high contrast, greyscale)
* Check your use of colour (good contrast, other styling)
* [web only] Try an automated testing tool such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)

Or pick a checklist to follow for a deeper dive:

* [A learn-as-you-do accessibility checklist](https://uxdesign.cc/a-learn-as-you-do-accessibility-checklist-c657d9ed2c62)
* [A11y Project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
* [Perform an accessibility review on your website](https://kb.iu.edu/d/atmv)

## I create papers, blog posts, videos...

* Check use of colour
* Ensure images have alt text (unless they are decorative)
* Provide a text alternative for complex images such as charts, graphs, maps
* Ensure videos have human-generated captions and/or transcripts

## I guide project direction

* Set a11y requirements and targets for development
    * e.g. use automated a11y tests in CI (we use [pa11y](https://pa11y.org))
* Prioritise a11y in the planning process
    * treat a11y issues as bugs!
* Arrange user testing, including disabled users
* Arrange a professional a11y audit

## I guide organisational direction

* Set a11y requirements and targets for projects
* Invest in a11y training for developers
* Follow an [accessibility playbook](https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/)
* Consider using a maturity model ([simple](https://www.metamatrix.se/avocado) or [advanced](https://abilitynet.org.uk/accessibility-services/DAMM))

## I can influence funding bodies

* Push for a11y to be prioritised in _all_ research outputs (including but not limited to software)
* Reward grant applications that describe how they will consider and design for disabled users

## I want to learn more

* [web-a11y Slack](web-a11y.slack.com) - a community of practice with thousands of a11y practitioners, from beginner to expert
* [The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/learn/web-accessibility/the-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-introduction-to-web-accessibility) - edX self-study course
* [A11y Project - Resources](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/) - huge collection of books, blogs, podcasts, and tools

Talk to me if you'd like to be part of an a11y-focused subcommunity/learning group!

# Web Accessibility Principles

POUR

# Developer-level suggestions

## Keyboard-only/mouse-only tests

_Important for: users with reduced mobility, screen reader users_

* try to complete a common task using _only_ the keyboard
* are there focus indicators to show you what's selected?
* can you get to all the controls?
![](images/keyboard_focus.png){fig-alt="Grey navigation bar with one element having a blue and white border and lighter text than the rest"}
* now try the same task with _only_ the mouse
* are there focus indicators when you hover over controls?
* do you sometimes need to press a specific keyboard key to continue?
![](images/cursor_focus.png){fig-alt="Grey navigation bar with one element having lighter text than the rest"}

---

## Visual settings tests

_Important for: users with reduced vision and/or colour vision_

* zoom to 200% or more
* enable a high contrast mode (settings: High Contrast/Increase Contrast)
* enable greyscale mode (settings: Color Filters/Color Correction)

::: {layout="[[70,30]]"}

![](images/zoom_200.png){fig-alt="A page with two columns overlapping each other. On the left is text with some warnings and links. On the right is a form with some select inputs. The content in the left column overlaps with the form labels and help text in the right column, making the page difficult to read."}

* are all controls and text distinguishable?
* do elements disappear or overlap?

    * colour + shape/icon
